# Meta Post Draft v2

My most successful post about AI slop was 95% AI-generated. Nobody noticed.

Last Monday I published a post warning about "workslop"—AI-generated materials that look professional but lack substance.

5,210 impressions. 33 comments. 60 reactions.

For reference, that's a 1.8% engagement rate. One of my best-performing posts in months.

The irony: I wrote maybe 5% of it. Claude Code wrote the rest.

Here's what happened:

For years, I've been tagging reading highlights in my notes. Specific paragraphs from articles I thought could become social posts. Hundreds of them, just sitting there, tagged but never used.

A few weeks ago I discovered Claude Code could actually read those highlights—they're stored as markdown files in LogSeq. So I asked it to scan my highlights tagged "social post," pick the best ones, and draft posts from them.

It found the workslop concept from an HBR article. Read the full source material. Analyzed my voice from previous posts. Generated a draft.

I changed maybe three words and deleted one sentence.

Nobody in the comments said "this sounds AI-generated." A few critical people in my network who would definitely call that out. Nothing.

So what made this different from actual slop?

Context.

I'd spent years curating those highlights. Tagging what mattered to me. Building a database of my thinking without realizing it.

When Claude Code accessed that context—my curated sources, my tags, my voice patterns from previous posts—it had what it needed to write something authentic.

I wasn't just hitting a button and hoping for good output. I was pulling from years of context engineering I'd done before the term even existed.

Have you built up curated context that AI could use?
