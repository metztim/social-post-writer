# Tim's LinkedIn Voice & Style Guide

> A comprehensive analysis of Tim's authentic writing voice based on 7 LinkedIn posts (Sept-Oct 2025)

---

## Quick Reference: The 15 Most Critical Voice Patterns

1. **Open with concrete specificity** — No vague abstractions. Start with "I posted every weekday for a month" not "Consistency is important"
2. **Use conversational asides in parentheticals** — "(Deadly sin, I know.)" "(Not sure how to get started?)"
3. **Deploy strategic line breaks** — Single blank lines create breathing room and emphasis
4. **Mix sentence lengths radically** — Long exploratory sentences followed by short punchy ones. "That's it."
5. **Lead with the specific, arrive at the universal** — Personal story → broader insight, not the reverse
6. **Use numbered lists for structured thinking** — But always with context before and reflection after
7. **End with questions that invite thinking, not just answers** — "If not through writing, how do you think?"
8. **Embrace contradictions explicitly** — "Two things I learned contradict each other completely"
9. **Use em dashes liberally** — For asides, clarifications, and rhythm
10. **Keep paragraphs SHORT** — Mostly 1-3 sentences. White space is your friend.
11. **Deploy single-emoji closers sparingly** — 🧅 at the very end, no emoji salad
12. **Start sections with concrete actions or situations** — "You think you're designing..." "I opened Claude Code and said..."
13. **Use informal contractions freely** — "It's," "you'll," "I'm" — never stiff
14. **Ground abstractions in examples immediately** — Never leave a concept floating
15. **Write like you talk** — But edited for clarity, not transcribed

## Voice & Tone

### Pattern Description

Tim's voice is **conversational-intellectual**: he writes like he's talking to a smart colleague at a coffee shop, not presenting at a conference. The tone shifts between:
- Self-deprecating humor ("Deadly sin, I know")
- Genuine curiosity ("My question for today...")
- Technical precision (when describing workflows)
- Reflective depth (when exploring ideas)

He's never:
- Salesy or promotional
- Overly formal or academic
- Preachy or prescriptive
- Defensive or aggressive

### Examples from Posts

**Self-deprecating openness:**
> "The reason for trying again is a bit shameful: our Animalz style guide was outdated, and I'd sometimes finish articles so close to deadline that I couldn't run them past our copy-editors anymore."

**Conversational directness:**
> "You think you're designing an AI workflow. Turns out you're peeling an onion with three layers"

**Reflective contemplation:**
> "I've always been agnostic about it: show me a better way to think than writing, and I can be convinced."

**Understated excitement:**
> "It actually worked, and I got back a copy-edited version of my article!"

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Admit mistakes and limitations openly
- Use "I" statements about personal experience
- Write like you're explaining something interesting you discovered
- Mix technical precision with human vulnerability
- Use humor that's self-aware, not self-aggrandizing

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start with "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Use corporate buzzword soup without irony
- Present yourself as having all the answers
- Hide the messy reality behind polished narratives
- Use excessive enthusiasm or hype

---

## Structure

### Pattern Description

Tim uses **scaffolding structures** that guide readers through complexity:

1. **Concrete hook** (personal story, specific claim)
2. **Context/backstory** (often admitting a problem or tension)
3. **The thing itself** (numbered steps, examples, or exploration)
4. **Reflection/implication** (what this means more broadly)
5. **Question or invitation** (drawing readers in)

He frequently uses:
- **Numbered lists** for multi-part processes or ideas
- **Bullet points** for parallel items or options
- **Extended metaphors** (onions, layers) sustained throughout
- **Before/after contrasts** (Normal AI vs. Socratic AI)
- **Explicit contradictions** ("Two things I learned contradict each other completely")

### Examples from Posts

**Classic structure (Claude Code style guide):**
1. Hook: "Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been trying to create an AI styleguide checker."
2. Backstory: "The reason for trying again is a bit shameful..."
3. The process: Three numbered steps for what Claude did
4. The result: "It actually worked..."
5. Invitation: "You can replicate this yourself..."

**Contradiction structure (Superpath daily posting):**
1. Set up tension: "Two things I learned contradict each other completely"
2. Present contradiction 1: "Posting daily is easier..."
3. Present contradiction 2: "Posting daily is too much"
4. Resolve tension: "For October, I'm trying this..."
5. Invite discussion: "If you've done daily posting, what did you learn?"

**Layered metaphor (Workflow onion):**
1. Metaphor introduction: "Workflows are like onions"
2. Three layers enumerated and explained
3. Example grounding each layer
4. Broader implication: "AI implementations spiral out..."
5. Metaphor callback: "🧅"

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Start with the specific, concrete, personal
- Use numbered lists when ideas have sequence or priority
- Create breathing room with line breaks between sections
- Return to opening metaphors or themes at the end
- Give readers a structural roadmap early (numbered list, stated contradiction)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start with broad abstract generalizations
- Use bullets when sequence matters (use numbers)
- Create walls of text without paragraph breaks
- Introduce new metaphors at the end
- Make readers guess where you're going

---

## Sentence Patterns

### Pattern Description

Tim's sentences have **extreme dynamic range**:
- Long, exploratory sentences (20-35 words) with multiple clauses
- Medium explanatory sentences (10-20 words)
- Short declarative punches (2-6 words) — "That's it." "Hard enough."

**Rhythm pattern:** He often follows a long sentence with a short one for emphasis.

**Sentence types:**
- Declarative statements (most common)
- Questions (strategic, at transitions and endings)
- Fragments (rare, but used for emphasis)

### Examples from Posts

**Long → Short punch:**
> "While the rhythm is helpful, a post a day also has disadvantages: Sometimes you post something half-baked. Some days you spend 50+ minutes on a post when you budgeted 25."
> "So what to do with this tension?"

**Fragment for emphasis:**
> "Hard enough." (After explaining the first layer of complexity)

**Compound complexity:**
> "Putting something down on paper forces you to face the gaps and absurdities and assumptions going on in your fuzzy thinking brain."

**List of short items:**
> "• 25 mins of post writing and research every day.
> • Two published posts per week on fixed days: Tuesdays and Thursdays."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Vary sentence length dramatically within paragraphs
- Use short sentences after complex ideas for emphasis
- Build rhythm with parallel structures in lists
- Let sentences run when exploring complexity
- Use fragments sparingly for punch

❌ **DON'T:**
- Keep all sentences the same length
- Make every sentence complex and long
- Use fragments frequently (loses impact)
- Fear long sentences when they serve the thought
- Sacrifice clarity for stylistic variation

---

## Punctuation & Formatting

### Pattern Description

Tim's punctuation creates **rhythm and breath**:

**Em dashes (—)** are his signature move:
- For asides and clarifications
- To introduce examples or elaborations
- To create dramatic pauses
- Often multiple per post

**Parentheticals** create a conversational aside:
- Self-aware commentary
- Definitional clarity
- Acknowledgment of reader questions

**Line breaks** are strategic:
- Single blank line between paragraphs (always)
- Extra space before/after numbered lists
- Extra space before major transitions

**Other marks:**
- Colons for introducing lists or elaborations
- Quotation marks for direct quotes or referenced phrases
- Bold for emphasis (rarely, but when used: company names, key terms)
- Arrows (→) in bullet lists occasionally

### Examples from Posts

**Em dash mastery:**
> "Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT have already gutted click-throughs to content sources. But autonomous agents are worse: they scan your content, use it to make decisions or take actions, and move on. Humans are hardly involved, so the probability of them visiting your site is close to zero."

**Parenthetical aside:**
> "(Deadly sin, I know.)"
> "(Not sure how to get started with Claude Code? We've just released a getting started guide on the Animalz blog -- link below in the comments.)"

**Arrow bullets:**
> "→ Sometimes you post something half-baked
> → Some days you spend 50+ minutes on a post when you budgeted 25"

**Strategic line breaks:**
Posts consistently use white space to separate ideas. Numbered lists have space before and after. Major transitions get breathing room.

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Use em dashes liberally for asides and elaborations
- Put self-aware commentary in parentheses
- Give ideas breathing room with line breaks
- Use colons to introduce what follows
- Keep formatting clean and scannable

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use semicolons (Tim doesn't)
- Create walls of text without breaks
- Over-format with bold/italic/underline
- Use multiple punctuation marks (!!!, ???)
- Forget white space is a design element

---

## Hooks

### Pattern Description

Tim's hooks are **concrete, personal, and surprising**:

**Types of hooks:**
1. **Specific personal action:** "I posted on LinkedIn every weekday for a month"
2. **Problem confession:** "Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been trying to create an AI styleguide checker. It's never worked, until..."
3. **Surprising juxtaposition:** "You think you're designing an AI workflow. Turns out you're peeling an onion"
4. **Provocative question:** "What if AI stopped answering and started teaching instead?"
5. **Recent discovery:** "Remember the AI style guide creator I built with Claude Code? It's now a published plugin"

**Never:**
- Generic industry observations
- "Imagine if..." scenarios
- Statistics without story
- Abstract philosophy without grounding

### Examples from Posts

**Problem → breakthrough:**
> "Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been trying to create an AI styleguide checker. It's never worked, until I tried with Claude Code last week."

**Contradiction hook:**
> "I posted on LinkedIn every weekday for a month. Two things I learned contradict each other completely:"

**Surprising shift:**
> "You think you're designing an AI workflow. Turns out you're peeling an onion with three layers:"

**What if reframe:**
> "What if AI stopped answering and started teaching instead? Most models rush to solve your problems. Use the prompt below to turn them into contemplative monks."

**Rapid escalation:**
> "Remember the AI style guide creator I built with Claude Code? It's now a published plugin. In an Animalz plugin marketplace. That didn't exist 30 minutes ago. And I didn't build any of it."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Start with what actually happened to you
- Create curiosity gaps ("It's never worked, until...")
- Use surprising juxtapositions (workflows = onions)
- Set up contradictions explicitly
- Make the first line do real work

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start with "Have you ever wondered..."
- Use generic industry observations
- Begin with statistics without human story
- Open with abstract philosophy
- Save the interesting part for later

## Examples & Evidence

### Pattern Description

Tim **grounds every abstraction** with concrete examples:

**Evidence types he uses:**
1. **Personal anecdotes** (most common) — his own experience
2. **Direct quotes** from named sources (Shane Parrish, Kevin Kelly, Gretchen Rubin)
3. **Specific technical details** (workflow steps, commands, tools)
4. **Before/after contrasts** (Normal AI vs. Socratic AI)
5. **Numbered scenarios** (Example 1, Example 2, Example 3)

**Pattern:** Universal insight → Specific example → Back to implication

**Style:**
- Examples are vivid and detailed, not generic
- Often uses dialogue/prompts to show not tell
- Names real tools, people, companies
- Admits messy reality, doesn't sanitize

### Examples from Posts

**Quote as foundation:**
> "This quote is on my mind: 'Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about.' — Shane Parrish, Farnam Street"

**Multiple scenario examples:**
> "Example 1: Career decision
> 🤖 Normal AI: 'Based on your experience, you should pursue the Director role—it offers a 30% higher salary.'
> 🤔 Socratic AI: 'What would success look like in each role, beyond the title?'"

**Technical specificity:**
> "1. Analyze three blog posts from 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 (15 in total) along factors that style guides and copyeditors typically pay attention to.
> 2. Build a new style guide from the patterns.
> 3. Flag conflicts for me to resolve."

**Named tools and people:**
> "Example: Peter Carlton and I are building a series of AirOps workflows..."
> "Claude researched, selected, and set up a database using Neon for me..."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Ground every abstract claim with specific example
- Name real people, tools, companies
- Use actual dialogue or prompts when relevant
- Show the messy specifics, not sanitized versions
- Use before/after contrasts to clarify differences

❌ **DON'T:**
- Make abstract claims without examples
- Use generic "Company X" or "a friend" when you can name names
- Summarize where you can quote
- Present only the polished success story
- Skip the technical details when they matter

---

## Transitions

### Pattern Description

Tim's transitions are **explicit signposts** that tell you where you're going:

**Transition types:**
1. **Numbered sequences** ("1. First layer... 2. Second layer... 3. Third layer...")
2. **Explicit pivots** ("So what to do with this tension?")
3. **Causal connectors** ("That brought us to step 2...")
4. **Temporal markers** ("Now we've started work on the third layer...")
5. **Logical progressions** ("Of course, all of this is on my mind because...")

**Style:**
- Transitions are visible, not hidden
- Often set up as questions before answering
- Use words like: "So," "Now," "Of course," "Example:"
- New sections often get line break + explicit reframe

### Examples from Posts

**Explicit question transition:**
> "So what to do with this tension?"
> "So yes, there's a need for content created just for AI agents..."

**Numbered progression:**
> "1. Nailing the workflow itself... 2. The 'UX' of the workflow... 3. The organizational 'fallout'..."

**Causal connector:**
> "That brought us to step 2: 'polishing' the workflow..."
> "Of course, all of this is on my mind because AI promises us we can skip or cut short this process."

**Temporal marker:**
> "Now we've started work on the third, outer layer of the onion..."
> "For October, I'm trying this:"

**Explicit example marker:**
> "Example: Peter Carlton and I are building a series of AirOps workflows..."
> "Example 1: Career decision"

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Use numbered sequences when structure is clear
- Set up transitions as questions
- Use explicit markers ("So," "Now," "Example:")
- Signal major shifts with line breaks
- Make the logical flow visible

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hide transitions or make readers guess
- Use subtle/poetic transitions (save for literary essays)
- Jump between ideas without connective tissue
- Overuse "However" or "Nevertheless"
- Transition without context

## CTAs & Endings

### Pattern Description

Tim **invites thinking, not action**:

**Ending types:**
1. **Reflective questions** (most common) — "If not through writing, how do you think?"
2. **Specific invitations** — "If you've done daily posting, what did you learn?"
3. **How-to offers** — "You can replicate this yourself..."
4. **Resource pointers** — Link in comments, GitHub link
5. **Single emoji closers** — Used sparingly, always relevant to content

**Never:**
- Hard sells
- "Follow me for more"
- Generic "What do you think?"
- Multiple CTAs competing

**Pattern:** The ending connects to the opening theme or extends the thinking

### Examples from Posts

**Reflective question:**
> "My question for today: if not through writing, how do you think?"
> "What question will you explore first?"

**Community invitation:**
> "If you've done daily posting, what did you learn?"
> "Big thanks to the Superpath community challenge hosted by Eric Doty and everyone who participated! 🙏"

**Replication offer:**
> "You can replicate this yourself with Claude Code, whether you're working from an existing style guide or reverse engineering one from scratch based on content you already have."

**Resource pointer:**
> "(Not sure how to get started with Claude Code? We've just released a getting started guide on the Animalz blog -- link below in the comments.)"

**Emoji callback:**
> "So beware choking on the onion when you plan to implement AI (workflows) systematically in your company...
> 🧅"

**Simple command invitation:**
> "Launch Claude Code, then use these commands:
> /plugin marketplace add animalzinc/claude-plugins
> /plugin install blog-style-guide-creator
> That's it."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- End with questions that require thinking, not just answers
- Make invitations specific to the post's content
- Offer resources naturally, in parentheses or P.S.
- Use single relevant emoji as punctuation (optional)
- Connect ending back to opening theme

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ask generic "What do you think?" questions
- Add "Follow me for more" or growth hacks
- Include multiple competing CTAs
- Use emoji salad (🚀💡🔥🎯)
- End abruptly without invitation

### Pattern Description

Tim has **recurring verbal fingerprints**:

**Meta-commentary phrases:**
- "(I know.)"
- "Of course..."
- "Sure, you can..."
- "For context:"
- "P.S."

**Logical connectors:**
- "Turns out..."
- "So yes..."
- "That brought us to..."
- "By the time..."

**Conversational markers:**

**Conversational markers:**
> "I thought: 'Maybe my style guide creator could be one of those.'"
> "Here's what happened:"
> "Want to try this approach? Start your chat with this prompt:"

**Direct address:**
> "You think you're designing an AI workflow."
> "You can replicate this yourself..."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Use parenthetical asides for self-aware commentary
- Deploy "Turns out" for revealing surprises
- Frame sections with "Here's what happened:"
- Admit imperfections ("a bit shameful," "kinda messy")
- Address reader directly as "you"

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use corporate jargon unironically
- Say "leverage" when you mean "use"
- Write "utilize" instead of "use"
- Overuse qualifiers (becomes hedging)
- Distance yourself with third person

---

## Personal vs. Professional Balance

### Pattern Description

Tim **leads with personal, arrives at professional**:

**Personal elements:**
- Admits mistakes and struggles openly
- Shares specific work situations
- Names colleagues and collaborators
- Reveals thinking process, including dead ends
- Uses "I" statements about experience

**Professional elements:**
- Technical precision when describing tools/workflows
- Industry insights and implications
- Practical how-to information
- Links to resources and tools
- Company mentions (Animalz, Anthropic, etc.)

**Balance:** ~60% personal voice/story, ~40% professional insight/utility

**Key insight:** Personal authenticity creates trust for professional recommendations

### Examples from Posts

**Personal vulnerability:**
> "The reason for trying again is a bit shameful: our Animalz style guide was outdated, and I'd sometimes finish articles so close to deadline that I couldn't run them past our copy-editors anymore."

**Personal process revealed:**
> "I've always been agnostic about it: show me a better way to think than writing, and I can be convinced."

**Professional precision:**
> "Critically, I told Claude Code to use multiple agents, each one focused on a different aspect: headers and capitalization, punctuation, grammar, etc."

**Named collaborations:**
> "Example: Peter Carlton and I are building a series of AirOps workflows to support LinkedIn thought leadership for execs and founders."

**Professional implications from personal experience:**
> "As a content creator, it breaks my heart. Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT have already gutted click-throughs to content sources."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Start with personal experience/story
- Admit mistakes and limitations
- Name specific people you work with
- Show your thinking process, not just results
- Balance vulnerability with expertise

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hide behind corporate "we"
- Present only polished successes
- Separate personal from professional artificially
- Overshare personal details unrelated to topic
- Be purely promotional about work

---

## Additional Patterns Worth Noting

### Metaphor Usage

Tim uses extended metaphors sustained throughout a piece:
- Onions and layers (workflow post)
- Contemplative monks (Socratic AI post)

**Pattern:** Introduce early, develop through middle, callback at end

### List Formatting

**Numbered lists:** For sequential steps or hierarchical ideas
**Bullet points:** For parallel items or options
**Arrow bullets (→):** For disadvantages or sub-points

**Always:** Context before list, reflection after list

### Attribution Style

When quoting or referencing others:
- Full attribution with name and source
- Direct quotes in quotation marks
- Extended quotes indented or set apart
- Gracious acknowledgment of communities and collaborators

### Technical Content

When explaining technical processes:
- Step-by-step numbered instructions
- Actual commands/code shown exactly as used
- Specificity over generalization
- Admits when things are "messy" or "clunky"

### Honesty About Limitations

Tim regularly acknowledges:
- What he doesn't know
- Where things didn't work
- Trade-offs and downsides
- Unresolved tensions

**This creates credibility, not weakness**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Starting abstract, getting specific**
- Wrong: "AI is transforming content creation. Here's an example..."
- Right: "I posted every weekday for a month. Here's what I learned..."

**❌ Hiding behind polish**
- Wrong: "We successfully implemented an innovative solution..."
- Right: "It was kinda messy, but it actually worked..."

**❌ Generic endings**
- Wrong: "What do you think? Let me know in the comments!"
- Right: "If not through writing, how do you think?"

**❌ Burying the lede**
- Wrong: Building up slowly to the interesting part
- Right: "It's now a published plugin. In an Animalz plugin marketplace. That didn't exist 30 minutes ago."

**❌ Wall-of-text paragraphs**
- Wrong: Multiple ideas crammed into single paragraphs
- Right: One idea per paragraph, white space for breath

**❌ Forgetting to ground abstractions**
- Wrong: "AI workflows require careful consideration of organizational impacts"
- Right: "Building such a system is a technical challenge, an expertise challenge, and perhaps even an org design challenge (do we need new / adjusted roles for any of this?)."

## Final Notes on Voice

**What makes Tim's voice distinctive:**

1. **Intellectual humility** — Admits what he doesn't know, shares failures alongside successes
2. **Conversational precision** — Casual tone but technically accurate
3. **Personal grounding** — Universal insights anchored in specific personal experience
4. **Structural clarity** — Always gives readers a roadmap
5. **Invitation over prescription** — Ends with questions, not commandments
6. **Appropriate enthusiasm** — Excited about discoveries, never hype-y
7. **Technical authenticity** — Shows actual commands, actual process, actual mess

**The underlying philosophy:**

Tim writes to think, not to convince. He shares discoveries, not prescriptions. He invites dialogue, not followers. He admits complexity, not simplicity. He values authenticity over polish.

**The golden rule:**

When in doubt, ask: "Is this how I'd explain this to a smart colleague at a coffee shop?" If yes, you're in Tim's voice. If no, you're probably being too formal, too abstract, or too salesy.
