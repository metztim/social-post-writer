# Tim's LinkedIn Voice & Style Guide - v2

> Comprehensive analysis based on 8 LinkedIn posts (Sept-Oct 2025), with critical additions from workslop post editing patterns

---

## Updates in v2

This version adds critical findings from detailed textual comparison of Claude-generated draft vs. user's published version of the "workslop" post. Key additions:

- **Word-level precision:** "coworker" not "colleague", "materials" not "content"
- **Delete patterns:** Meta-commentary, accusatory you/I framing, editorial flourishes, question framing
- **Add patterns:** Playful irony ("congrats"), specific sources (BetterUp Labs + Stanford), conversational transitions
- **Rhythm techniques:** Line breaks for emotional buildup/staccato effect
- **CTA simplification:** One simple question, no framing
- **Source attribution:** Include link references in parentheses
- **Tense precision:** Past perfect for failed actions ("should have done")

All v1 content preserved and enhanced.

## Quick Reference: The 15 Most Critical Voice Patterns

1. **Open with concrete specificity** — No vague abstractions. Start with "I posted every weekday for a month" not "Consistency is important"
2. **Use conversational asides in parentheticals** — "(Deadly sin, I know.)" "(Not sure how to get started?)"
3. **Deploy strategic line breaks** — Single blank lines create breathing room and emphasis. Use staccato rhythm for emotional buildup.
4. **Mix sentence lengths radically** — Long exploratory sentences followed by short punchy ones. "That's it."
5. **Lead with the specific, arrive at the universal** — Personal story → broader insight, not the reverse
6. **Use numbered lists for structured thinking** — But always with context before and reflection after
7. **End with questions that invite thinking, not just answers** — "If not through writing, how do you think?"
8. **Embrace contradictions explicitly** — "Two things I learned contradict each other completely"
9. **Use em dashes liberally** — For asides, clarifications, and rhythm
10. **Keep paragraphs SHORT** — Mostly 1-3 sentences. White space is your friend.
11. **Deploy single-emoji closers sparingly** — 🧅 at the very end, no emoji salad
12. **Start sections with concrete actions or situations** — "You think you're designing..." "I opened Claude Code and said..."
13. **Use informal contractions freely** — "It's," "you'll," "I'm" — never stiff
14. **Ground abstractions in examples immediately** — Never leave a concept floating
15. **Write like you talk** — But edited for clarity, not transcribed

## Voice & Tone

### Pattern Description

Tim's voice is **conversational-intellectual**: he writes like he's talking to a smart colleague at a coffee shop, not presenting at a conference. The tone shifts between:
- Self-deprecating humor ("Deadly sin, I know")
- Genuine curiosity ("My question for today...")
- Technical precision (when describing workflows)
- Reflective depth (when exploring ideas)
- **Playful irony** (when introducing negative concepts: "congrats, you've been workslopped!")

He's never:
- Salesy or promotional
- Overly formal or academic
- Preachy or prescriptive
- Defensive or aggressive
- **Accusatory or blame-focused** (avoids "You did X, I suffer Y" framing)

### Examples from Posts

**Self-deprecating openness:**
> "The reason for trying again is a bit shameful: our Animalz style guide was outdated, and I'd sometimes finish articles so close to deadline that I couldn't run them past our copy-editors anymore."

**Conversational directness:**
> "You think you're designing an AI workflow. Turns out you're peeling an onion with three layers"

**Reflective contemplation:**
> "I've always been agnostic about it: show me a better way to think than writing, and I can be convinced."

**Understated excitement:**
> "It actually worked, and I got back a copy-edited version of my article!"

**Playful irony (NEW):**
> "If this sounds familiar, congrats, you've been workslopped!"

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Admit mistakes and limitations openly
- Use "I" statements about personal experience
- Write like you're explaining something interesting you discovered
- Mix technical precision with human vulnerability
- Use humor that's self-aware, not self-aggrandizing
- **Add playful irony when introducing negative concepts reader might relate to**
- **Trust the reader to understand implications without editorial commentary**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start with "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Use corporate buzzword soup without irony
- Present yourself as having all the answers
- Hide the messy reality behind polished narratives
- Use excessive enthusiasm or hype
- **Use "colleague" (say "coworker" instead)**
- **Use accusatory "you/I" framing ("You used AI to save time, I lost time")**
- **Add meta-commentary ("There's a name for this now", "Here's what's interesting")**
- **Include editorial flourishes that over-explain what's already clear**

---

## Word Choice Precision (NEW)

### Always Use / Never Use

| ❌ Never Use | ✅ Always Use |
|--------------|---------------|
| colleague | coworker |
| work content | materials |
| content (in professional contexts) | materials |

### Phrases to Delete Entirely

- **"There's a name for this now"** — Skip meta-commentary, just introduce the concept
- **"Turns out [statement]"** — State the finding directly
- **"Let me tell you why this matters"** — If it's clear, don't explain it
- **"The real problem is..."** — Just state the problem
- **"The key is..."** — Too declarative; show instead

---

## Structure

### Pattern Description

Tim uses **scaffolding structures** that guide readers through complexity:

1. **Concrete hook** (personal story, specific claim)
2. **Context/backstory** (often admitting a problem or tension)
3. **The thing itself** (numbered steps, examples, or exploration)
4. **Reflection/implication** (what this means more broadly)
5. **Question or invitation** (drawing readers in)

He frequently uses:
- **Numbered lists** for multi-part processes or ideas
- **Bullet points** for parallel items or options (especially stats)
- **Extended metaphors** (onions, layers) sustained throughout
- **Before/after contrasts** (Normal AI vs. Socratic AI)
- **Explicit contradictions** ("Two things I learned contradict each other completely")
- **Line breaks for rhythm** — Staccato sentences on separate lines for emotional buildup

### Examples from Posts

**Classic structure (Claude Code style guide):**
1. Hook: "Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been trying to create an AI styleguide checker."
2. Backstory: "The reason for trying again is a bit shameful..."
3. The process: Three numbered steps for what Claude did
4. The result: "It actually worked..."
5. Invitation: "You can replicate this yourself..."

**Contradiction structure (Superpath daily posting):**
1. Set up tension: "Two things I learned contradict each other completely"
2. Present contradiction 1: "Posting daily is easier..."
3. Present contradiction 2: "Posting daily is too much"
4. Resolve tension: "For October, I'm trying this..."
5. Invite discussion: "If you've done daily posting, what did you learn?"

**Staccato rhythm for emotional buildup (NEW - from workslop post):**
```
But as you start reading, something feels off.

The content is vague.
Key details are missing.
You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this.
```

Each problem on its own line creates mounting tension.

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Start with the specific, concrete, personal
- Use numbered lists when ideas have sequence or priority
- Create breathing room with line breaks between sections
- Return to opening metaphors or themes at the end
- Give readers a structural roadmap early (numbered list, stated contradiction)
- **Use line breaks to create staccato rhythm when building emotion or listing problems**
- **Give stats visual space with bullets and white space**
- **Merge opening paragraphs for momentum, then break for the "turn" moment**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start with broad abstract generalizations
- Use bullets when sequence matters (use numbers)
- Create walls of text without paragraph breaks
- Introduce new metaphors at the end
- Make readers guess where you're going
- **Cram stats into dense paragraphs**

---

## Sentence Patterns

### Pattern Description

Tim's sentences have **extreme dynamic range**:
- Long, exploratory sentences (20-35 words) with multiple clauses
- Medium explanatory sentences (10-20 words)
- Short declarative punches (2-6 words) — "That's it." "Hard enough."
- **Staccato single-line sentences for emotional emphasis** (NEW)

**Rhythm pattern:** He often follows a long sentence with a short one for emphasis. Also uses line breaks to isolate short sentences for mounting tension.

**Sentence types:**
- Declarative statements (most common)
- Questions (strategic, at transitions and endings)
- Fragments (rare, but used for emphasis)

### Examples from Posts

**Long → Short punch:**
> "While the rhythm is helpful, a post a day also has disadvantages: Sometimes you post something half-baked. Some days you spend 50+ minutes on a post when you budgeted 25."
> "So what to do with this tension?"

**Fragment for emphasis:**
> "Hard enough." (After explaining the first layer of complexity)

**Compound complexity:**
> "Putting something down on paper forces you to face the gaps and absurdities and assumptions going on in your fuzzy thinking brain."

**Staccato rhythm with line breaks (NEW):**
> "The content is vague.
> Key details are missing.
> You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Vary sentence length dramatically within paragraphs
- Use short sentences after complex ideas for emphasis
- Build rhythm with parallel structures in lists
- Let sentences run when exploring complexity
- Use fragments sparingly for punch
- **Use line breaks to isolate short sentences for emotional buildup**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Keep all sentences the same length
- Make every sentence complex and long
- Use fragments frequently (loses impact)
- Fear long sentences when they serve the thought
- Sacrifice clarity for stylistic variation
- **Delete redundant setup sentences** (If sentence 2 says what sentence 1 said, delete sentence 1)

---

## Punctuation & Formatting

### Pattern Description

Tim's punctuation creates **rhythm and breath**:

**Em dashes (—)** are his signature move:
- For asides and clarifications
- To introduce examples or elaborations
- To create dramatic pauses
- Often multiple per post

**Parentheticals** create a conversational aside:
- Self-aware commentary
- Definitional clarity
- Acknowledgment of reader questions
- **Source link references** (NEW): "(Full HBR article in the comments.)"

**Line breaks** are strategic:
- Single blank line between paragraphs (always)
- Extra space before/after numbered lists
- Extra space before major transitions
- **Line breaks within paragraphs for staccato rhythm** (NEW)

**Other marks:**
- Colons for introducing lists or elaborations
- Quotation marks for direct quotes or referenced phrases
- Bold for emphasis (rarely, but when used: company names, key terms)
- Arrows (→) in bullet lists occasionally
- **Exclamation points for playful irony** (NEW): "congrats, you've been workslopped!"

### Examples from Posts

**Em dash mastery:**
> "Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT have already gutted click-throughs to content sources. But autonomous agents are worse: they scan your content, use it to make decisions or take actions, and move on. Humans are hardly involved, so the probability of them visiting your site is close to zero."

**Parenthetical aside:**
> "(Deadly sin, I know.)"
> "(Not sure how to get started with Claude Code? We've just released a getting started guide on the Animalz blog -- link below in the comments.)"
> **(NEW)** "(Full HBR article in the comments.)"

**Arrow bullets:**
> "→ Sometimes you post something half-baked
> → Some days you spend 50+ minutes on a post when you budgeted 25"

**Strategic line breaks:**
Posts consistently use white space to separate ideas. Numbered lists have space before and after. Major transitions get breathing room. **Staccato sentences get individual lines for emotional buildup.**

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Use em dashes liberally for asides and elaborations
- Put self-aware commentary in parentheses
- Give ideas breathing room with line breaks
- Use colons to introduce what follows
- Keep formatting clean and scannable
- **Add source link references in parentheses at end**
- **Use exclamation points sparingly for playful irony**
- **Use line breaks within paragraphs to create staccato rhythm**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use semicolons (Tim doesn't)
- Create walls of text without breaks
- Over-format with bold/italic/underline
- Use multiple punctuation marks (!!!, ???)
- Forget white space is a design element

---

## Hooks

### Pattern Description

Tim's hooks are **concrete, personal, and surprising**:

**Types of hooks:**
1. **Specific personal action:** "I posted on LinkedIn every weekday for a month"
2. **Problem confession:** "Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been trying to create an AI styleguide checker. It's never worked, until..."
3. **Surprising juxtaposition:** "You think you're designing an AI workflow. Turns out you're peeling an onion"
4. **Provocative question:** "What if AI stopped answering and started teaching instead?"
5. **Recent discovery:** "Remember the AI style guide creator I built with Claude Code? It's now a published plugin"
6. **Recognition scenario (NEW):** "You open a document from a coworker. Looks professional at first. Formatted nicely, plenty of text. But as you start reading, something feels off."

**Never:**
- Generic industry observations
- "Imagine if..." scenarios
- Statistics without story
- Abstract philosophy without grounding

### Examples from Posts

**Problem → breakthrough:**
> "Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been trying to create an AI styleguide checker. It's never worked, until I tried with Claude Code last week."

**Contradiction hook:**
> "I posted on LinkedIn every weekday for a month. Two things I learned contradict each other completely:"

**Surprising shift:**
> "You think you're designing an AI workflow. Turns out you're peeling an onion with three layers:"

**Recognition scenario with playful turn (NEW):**
> "You open a document from a coworker. Looks professional at first. Formatted nicely, plenty of text. But as you start reading, something feels off.
>
> The content is vague.
> Key details are missing.
> You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this.
>
> If this sounds familiar, congrats, you've been workslopped!"

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Start with what actually happened to you
- Create curiosity gaps ("It's never worked, until...")
- Use surprising juxtapositions (workflows = onions)
- Set up contradictions explicitly
- Make the first line do real work
- **Build recognition scenarios with concrete details**
- **Add playful irony when introducing negative concepts ("congrats")**
- **Merge opening paragraphs for momentum until the "turn" moment**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Start with "Have you ever wondered..."
- Use generic industry observations
- Begin with statistics without human story
- Open with abstract philosophy
- Save the interesting part for later
- **Break up the opening too early with line breaks (wait for the turn)**

## Examples & Evidence

### Pattern Description

Tim **grounds every abstraction** with concrete examples:

**Evidence types he uses:**
1. **Personal anecdotes** (most common) — his own experience
2. **Direct quotes** from named sources (Shane Parrish, Kevin Kelly, Gretchen Rubin)
3. **Specific technical details** (workflow steps, commands, tools)
4. **Before/after contrasts** (Normal AI vs. Socratic AI)
5. **Numbered scenarios** (Example 1, Example 2, Example 3)
6. **Research with specific sources (NEW):** "researchers from BetterUp Labs and Stanford"
7. **Stats with visual formatting (NEW):** Bullets with white space

**Pattern:** Universal insight → Specific example → Back to implication

**Style:**
- Examples are vivid and detailed, not generic
- Often uses dialogue/prompts to show not tell
- Names real tools, people, companies
- Admits messy reality, doesn't sanitize
- **Always includes specific organization names, not just "researchers"**

### Examples from Posts

**Quote as foundation:**
> "This quote is on my mind: 'Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about.' — Shane Parrish, Farnam Street"

**Multiple scenario examples:**
> "Example 1: Career decision
> 🤖 Normal AI: 'Based on your experience, you should pursue the Director role—it offers a 30% higher salary.'
> 🤔 Socratic AI: 'What would success look like in each role, beyond the title?'"

**Research with specific sources (NEW):**
> "For the work context, researchers from BetterUp Labs and Stanford have coined this 'workslop'"

**Stats with visual space (NEW):**
> "The researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees and found that:
>
> • 40% received workslop in the last month
> • Each incident takes nearly 2 hours to deal with
> • For a 10,000-person company: $9 million/year in lost productivity"

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Ground every abstract claim with specific example
- Name real people, tools, companies
- Use actual dialogue or prompts when relevant
- Show the messy specifics, not sanitized versions
- Use before/after contrasts to clarify differences
- **Include specific organization names when citing research**
- **Format stats with bullets and white space for scannability**
- **Add source link references in parentheses**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Make abstract claims without examples
- Use generic "Company X" or "a friend" when you can name names
- Summarize where you can quote
- Present only the polished success story
- Skip the technical details when they matter
- **Use vague attribution like "researchers" without naming organizations**
- **Cram stats into paragraph format**

---

## Transitions

### Pattern Description

Tim's transitions are **explicit signposts** that tell you where you're going:

**Transition types:**
1. **Numbered sequences** ("1. First layer... 2. Second layer... 3. Third layer...")
2. **Explicit pivots** ("So what to do with this tension?")
3. **Causal connectors** ("That brought us to step 2...")
4. **Temporal markers** ("Now we've started work on the third layer...")
5. **Logical progressions** ("Of course, all of this is on my mind because...")
6. **Conversational markers (NEW):** "That's not all though."

**Style:**
- Transitions are visible, not hidden
- Often set up as questions before answering
- Use words like: "So," "Now," "Of course," "Example:"
- New sections often get line break + explicit reframe
- **Never use formal transitions:** "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "Nevertheless"

### Examples from Posts

**Explicit question transition:**
> "So what to do with this tension?"
> "So yes, there's a need for content created just for AI agents..."

**Numbered progression:**
> "1. Nailing the workflow itself... 2. The 'UX' of the workflow... 3. The organizational 'fallout'..."

**Causal connector:**
> "That brought us to step 2: 'polishing' the workflow..."
> "Of course, all of this is on my mind because AI promises us we can skip or cut short this process."

**Conversational marker (NEW):**
> "That's not all though. The interpersonal cost might be worse."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Use numbered sequences when structure is clear
- Set up transitions as questions
- Use explicit markers ("So," "Now," "Example:")
- Signal major shifts with line breaks
- Make the logical flow visible
- **Use conversational transitions like "That's not all though"**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Hide transitions or make readers guess
- Use subtle/poetic transitions (save for literary essays)
- Jump between ideas without connective tissue
- **Use formal academic transitions:** "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "Nevertheless," "However"
- Transition without context
- **Use "Turns out" as a transition phrase** (delete entirely)

---

## CTAs & Endings

### Pattern Description

Tim **invites thinking, not action**:

**Ending types:**
1. **Reflective questions** (most common) — "If not through writing, how do you think?"
2. **Specific invitations** — "If you've done daily posting, what did you learn?"
3. **How-to offers** — "You can replicate this yourself..."
4. **Resource pointers** — Link in comments, GitHub link
5. **Single emoji closers** — Used sparingly, always relevant to content

**CTA simplification (NEW from workslop analysis):**
- **One simple question only**
- **No framing** ("My question for today" → deleted)
- **No multiple follow-up questions**
- **Personal and memorable phrasing**

**Never:**
- Hard sells
- "Follow me for more"
- Generic "What do you think?"
- Multiple CTAs competing

**Pattern:** The ending connects to the opening theme or extends the thinking

### Examples from Posts

**Reflective question:**
> "My question for today: if not through writing, how do you think?"
> "What question will you explore first?"

**Community invitation:**
> "If you've done daily posting, what did you learn?"
> "Big thanks to the Superpath community challenge hosted by Eric Doty and everyone who participated! 🙏"

**Simple, direct CTA (NEW):**
❌ **Too wordy:** "My question for today: have you encountered workslop at work? How did you handle it?"
✅ **Actual:** "Have you been workslopped recently?"

**Resource pointer with source link (NEW):**
> "(Full HBR article in the comments.)"

**Emoji callback:**
> "So beware choking on the onion when you plan to implement AI (workflows) systematically in your company...
> 🧅"

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- End with questions that require thinking, not just answers
- Make invitations specific to the post's content
- Offer resources naturally, in parentheses or P.S.
- Use single relevant emoji as punctuation (optional)
- Connect ending back to opening theme
- **Keep CTA to one simple, direct question**
- **Add source link references in parentheses**

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ask generic "What do you think?" questions
- Add "Follow me for more" or growth hacks
- Include multiple competing CTAs
- Use emoji salad (🚀💡🔥🎯)
- End abruptly without invitation
- **Use framing like "My question for today:"** (just ask the question)
- **Ask multiple follow-up questions** (one only)

Tim has **recurring verbal fingerprints**:

**Meta-commentary phrases:**
- "(I know.)"
- "Of course..."
- "Sure, you can..."
- "For context:"
- "P.S."
- **AVOID (NEW):** "There's a name for this now", "Here's what's interesting", "Let me tell you why this matters"

> "For context: Last week I reverse-engineered our Animalz style guide..."

**Logical connectors:**
> "So yes, there's a need for content created just for AI agents"
> "That brought us to step 2: 'polishing' the workflow"
> **(NEW)** "That's not all though. The interpersonal cost might be worse."

**Conversational markers:**
> "I thought: 'Maybe my style guide creator could be one of those.'"
> "Here's what happened:"
> "Want to try this approach? Start your chat with this prompt:"

**Direct address:**
> "You think you're designing an AI workflow."
> "You can replicate this yourself..."

### ✅ DO / ❌ DON'T

✅ **DO:**
- Use parenthetical asides for self-aware commentary
- Frame sections with "Here's what happened:"
- Admit imperfections ("a bit shameful," "kinda messy")

- **Add meta-commentary like "There's a name for this now"**
- **Use accusatory "you" framing**

---

## Source Attribution & Tense Precision (NEW)

### Source Attribution Style

**Be specific with sources:**
❌ **Vague:** "Stanford surveyed 1,150 full-time employees."
❌ **Vague:** "At work, researchers call it workslop"

✅ **Specific:** "For the work context, researchers from BetterUp Labs and Stanford have coined this 'workslop'"
✅ **Subsequent references:** "The researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees and found that:"

**Always include source links:**
> "(Full HBR article in the comments.)"
> "(Link to research in comments.)"

### Tense Precision for Failed Actions

**Use past perfect for what should have happened but didn't:**

❌ **Present continuous:** "From the person who should be thinking"
✅ **Past perfect:** "From the person who should have done the thinking"

**Rule:** When describing what should have happened but didn't, use past perfect tense.

---

## Personal vs. Professional Balance

**Personal process revealed:**
> "I've always been agnostic about it: show me a better way to think than writing, and I can be convinced."

**Professional precision:**
> "Critically, I told Claude Code to use multiple agents, each one focused on a different aspect: headers and capitalization, punctuation, grammar, etc."

**Professional research presentation (NEW):**
> "For the work context, researchers from BetterUp Labs and Stanford have coined this 'workslop'"
>
> "The researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees and found that:

- **Use vague source attribution**

---

## Additional Patterns Worth Noting

### Metaphor Usage

Tim uses extended metaphors sustained throughout a piece:
- Onions and layers (workflow post)
- Contemplative monks (Socratic AI post)

**Pattern:** Introduce early, develop through middle, callback at end

### List Formatting

**Numbered lists:** For sequential steps or hierarchical ideas
**Bullet points:** For parallel items or options
**Arrow bullets (→):** For disadvantages or sub-points

**Always:** Context before list, reflection after list
**NEW:** Stats get visual space with bullets and white space

### Attribution Style

When quoting or referencing others:
- Full attribution with name and source
- Direct quotes in quotation marks
- Extended quotes indented or set apart
- Gracious acknowledgment of communities and collaborators
- **Specific organization names, not just "researchers" (NEW)**
- **Link references in parentheses at end (NEW)**

### Technical Content

When explaining technical processes:
- Step-by-step numbered instructions
- Actual commands/code shown exactly as used
- Specificity over generalization
- Admits when things are "messy" or "clunky"

### Honesty About Limitations

Tim regularly acknowledges:
- What he doesn't know
- Where things didn't work
- Trade-offs and downsides
- Unresolved tensions

**This creates credibility, not weakness**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Starting abstract, getting specific**
- Wrong: "AI is transforming content creation. Here's an example..."
- Right: "I posted every weekday for a month. Here's what I learned..."

**❌ Hiding behind polish**
- Wrong: "We successfully implemented an innovative solution..."
- Right: "It was kinda messy, but it actually worked..."

**❌ Generic endings**
- Wrong: "What do you think? Let me know in the comments!"
- Right: "If not through writing, how do you think?"

**❌ Burying the lede**
- Wrong: Building up slowly to the interesting part
- Right: "It's now a published plugin. In an Animalz plugin marketplace. That didn't exist 30 minutes ago."

**❌ Wall-of-text paragraphs**
- Wrong: Multiple ideas crammed into single paragraphs
- Right: One idea per paragraph, white space for breath

**❌ Forgetting to ground abstractions**
- Wrong: "AI workflows require careful consideration of organizational impacts"
- Right: "Building such a system is a technical challenge, an expertise challenge, and perhaps even an org design challenge (do we need new / adjusted roles for any of this?)."

**❌ Using "colleague" instead of "coworker" (NEW)**
- Wrong: "You open a document from a colleague."
- Right: "You open a document from a coworker."

**❌ Adding meta-commentary (NEW)**
- Wrong: "There's a name for this now: workslop"
- Right: "For the work context, researchers from BetterUp Labs and Stanford have coined this 'workslop'"

**❌ Accusatory you/I framing (NEW)**
- Wrong: "You used AI to save yourself time by not thinking. I lose time figuring out what you meant."
- Right: [Delete this entirely — focus on shared experience, not blame]

**❌ Over-complicating CTAs (NEW)**
- Wrong: "My question for today: have you encountered workslop at work? How did you handle it?"
- Right: "Have you been workslopped recently?"

**❌ Cramming stats into paragraphs (NEW)**
- Wrong: "The study found that 40% received workslop in the last month, each incident takes nearly 2 hours to deal with, and for a 10,000-person company that's $9 million/year in lost productivity."
- Right:
  ```
  The researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees and found that:

  • 40% received workslop in the last month
  • Each incident takes nearly 2 hours to deal with
  • For a 10,000-person company: $9 million/year in lost productivity
  ```

## Final Notes on Voice

**What makes Tim's voice distinctive:**

1. **Intellectual humility** — Admits what he doesn't know, shares failures alongside successes
2. **Conversational precision** — Casual tone but technically accurate
3. **Personal grounding** — Universal insights anchored in specific personal experience
4. **Structural clarity** — Always gives readers a roadmap
5. **Invitation over prescription** — Ends with questions, not commandments
6. **Appropriate enthusiasm** — Excited about discoveries, never hype-y
7. **Technical authenticity** — Shows actual commands, actual process, actual mess
8. **Playful irony (NEW)** — Light humor when introducing relatable negative concepts
9. **Source credibility (NEW)** — Specific organization names and link references
10. **Visual rhythm (NEW)** — Line breaks for emotional buildup, white space for stats

**The underlying philosophy:**

Tim writes to think, not to convince. He shares discoveries, not prescriptions. He invites dialogue, not followers. He admits complexity, not simplicity. He values authenticity over polish. **He trusts readers to understand implications without over-explaining.**

**The golden rule:**

When in doubt, ask: "Is this how I'd explain this to a smart colleague at a coffee shop?" If yes, you're in Tim's voice. If no, you're probably being too formal, too abstract, or too salesy.

**The editing principle (NEW from workslop analysis):**

Tim's editorial strength is in **deletion, not addition**. If you're unsure whether to include something:
- Is it meta-commentary? → Delete
- Does it tell readers how to feel? → Delete
- Is it accusatory? → Delete
- Does it over-explain what's clear? → Delete
- Is it redundant setup? → Delete

Give readers good raw material and trust them to follow.
