# Step 4: Draft Post Using Authentic Voice

## Purpose
Create a LinkedIn post draft from the selected entry using Tim's authentic voice patterns.

## Process

### 4.1: Load Voice Guides

**Required files:**
- `voice/tim-linkedin-voice-v2.md` - Voice guidelines and patterns
- `voice/tim-linguistic-fingerprint-v2.md` - What Tim does/doesn't say

Read both files completely before drafting.

### 4.2: Analyze Reference Samples

**Optional but helpful:**
- Review posts in `samples/tim/` for current patterns
- Identify similar post types for structural guidance
- Note recent successful patterns

### 4.3: Draft the Post

**Apply Tim's actual linguistic patterns:**
- Use his characteristic transitions (not AI generic ones)
- Match his sentence rhythm and white space usage
- Lead with concrete, specific, personal
- Trust white space—don't over-explain

**Avoid AI-isms:**
- No meta-commentary about the writing
- No "here's what I learned" framing (unless Tim actually uses it)
- No over-explanation of connections
- Check "Tim would never say" list

### 4.4: Self-Review

**Launch validation:**
```
Use Task tool to validate against Voice Authenticity Checklist
```

**Check for:**
- AI patterns (meta-commentary, over-explanation)
- Phrases from "never say" list
- Generic transitions vs Tim's actual ones
- Over-explained connections

**If issues found:**
- Revise before saving
- Use uncorrelated context for fresh validation

### 4.5: Draft Structure

**Typical LinkedIn post structure:**
- Hook (concrete, specific)
- Context (brief, relevant)
- Insight or observation
- Application or implication
- Optional: Question or call to engage

**White space:**
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Line breaks for emphasis
- Don't pack too tightly

## Quality Bar

**The draft must sound authentically like Tim:**
- Not "good LinkedIn copy"
- Not "professional content"
- **Tim's actual voice**

**If uncertain:**
- Flag for user review
- Better to admit uncertainty than fake it

## Success Criteria

- Draft sounds like Tim (not AI generic)
- No phrases from "never say" list
- Appropriate white space and rhythm
- Self-review validation passed
- Ready to save to Notion
