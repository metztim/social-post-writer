# Have you been "workslopped"? (DRAFT)

---

You open a document from a colleague. It looks professional—formatted nicely, plenty of text.

But as you start reading, something feels off.

*Wait, what is this exactly?*

The content is vague. Key details are missing. You're not sure what action you're supposed to take. And you realize: they probably just had AI generate this instead of thinking it through.

If this sounds familiar, you've been workslopped.

**What is workslop?**

On social media, low-quality AI-generated content is called "AI slop." At work, there's a specific flavor of this problem: workslop.

**Workslop** = AI-generated work content that masquerades as good work but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a task.

The problem isn't that someone used AI. It's that they used it to shift their cognitive burden onto you.

**The hidden cost**

Stanford researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees. The numbers are alarming:

• 40% received workslop in the last month
• Each incident takes nearly 2 hours to deal with
• That's a $186/month tax per employee
• For a 10,000-person company: $9 million/year in lost productivity

But the interpersonal damage may be worse:

• 50% viewed colleagues who sent workslop as less creative and capable
• 42% saw them as less trustworthy
• 37% saw them as less intelligent

As one individual contributor in finance put it: "It created a situation where I had to decide whether I would rewrite it myself, make him rewrite it, or just call it good enough."

**The real problem**

Workslop doesn't eliminate work—it transfers it.

From the person who should be thinking to the person who now has to decode the content, infer the missing context, and decide what to do.

From creator to receiver.

It's cognitive burden-shifting dressed up as productivity.

AI is a powerful tool. But using it to offload your thinking onto someone else's plate isn't collaboration. It's passing the buck with extra steps.

**My question for today: have you encountered workslop at work? How did you handle it?**

## Alternative Draft (Shorter, More Personal)

You've experienced this.

A colleague sends you a document. Looks good at first. But as you read, confusion sets in—*wait, what is this?*—before frustration. They just had AI write this instead of thinking it through.

There's a name for this now: workslop.

**Workslop** = AI-generated work that looks good but lacks substance to actually advance the task.

Stanford researchers found:
• 40% of workers got workslopped last month
• Each incident wastes nearly 2 hours
• 50% now see the sender as less capable

Here's the real problem:

Workslop doesn't eliminate work. It transfers it downstream.

You save time by not thinking. I lose time figuring out what you meant. You used AI to shift your cognitive burden onto my plate.

AI can be incredible for collaboration. But this isn't collaboration—it's burden-shifting with automation.

**Have you been workslopped? What did you do?**

## My Recommendation

I prefer the **first version** because it:
- Opens with the specific recognition moment (your highest-performing pattern)
- Uses your characteristic em-dash rhythm
- Admits the interpersonal tension directly
- Includes the compelling stats while keeping them grounded
- Has your signature line break pacing
- Ends with your reflective question style

The second version is punchier but loses some of the conversational breathing room that makes your posts distinctive.

Want me to adjust anything?
