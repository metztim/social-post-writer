# Workslop Post - Draft v2 (Authentic Voice)

---

You open a document from a colleague.

Looks professional at first. Formatted nicely, plenty of text.

But as you start reading, something feels off. The content is vague. Key details are missing. You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this.

Then it hits you: they probably just had AI generate this without thinking it through.

If this sounds familiar, you've been workslopped.

There's a name for this now. On social media, low-quality AI content is called "AI slop." At work, researchers call it **workslop**: AI-generated work content that masquerades as good work but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a task.

Stanford surveyed 1,150 full-time employees. Turns out this is everywhere:

• 40% received workslop in the last month
• Each incident takes nearly 2 hours to deal with
• For a 10,000-person company: $9 million/year in lost productivity

But the interpersonal cost might be worse.

Half the people who received workslop now view the sender as less creative and capable. 42% see them as less trustworthy. 37% see them as less intelligent.

One person in finance described it like this: "It created a situation where I had to decide whether I would rewrite it myself, make him rewrite it, or just call it good enough."

Workslop doesn't eliminate work. It shifts it downstream.

From the person who should be thinking to the person who now has to decode the content, infer the missing context, and figure out what to do.

You used AI to save yourself time by not thinking. I lose time figuring out what you meant.

AI can be powerful for collaboration. But this isn't collaboration—it's cognitive burden-shifting.

My question for today: have you encountered workslop at work? How did you handle it?

## What Changed

**Removed AI-isms:**
- ❌ "The real problem"
- ❌ "isn't... it's..." constructions
- ❌ "dressed up as productivity"
- ❌ "passing the buck with extra steps"

**Applied Tim's actual patterns:**
- ✅ White space as main transition tool
- ✅ "Turns out" for revelation
- ✅ Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences mostly)
- ✅ Radical sentence length variation
- ✅ "My question for today:" ending frame
- ✅ Direct quote without setup/summary
- ✅ Trust reader to follow jumps
- ✅ Simple "So" or "But" sentence starters

**Key difference:** Less explaining, more trusting white space and reader intelligence to make connections.

Does this feel more like you?
