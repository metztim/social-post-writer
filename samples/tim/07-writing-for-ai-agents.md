Will there be content created just for AI agents, not humans? A few months ago, this question seemed hypothetical. Now, I'm convinced the answer is yes.

The following scenario happens daily in my Claude Code sessions:

Me: "Please search the web for best practices related to {insert topic} from credible experts. Use the findings to improve your plan."

Claude launches searches across dozens of pages. My only interaction with content providers is approving domains Claude wants to visit.

Claude reads everything, uses it to make decisions or take actions, and move on. Humans are hardly involved, so the probability of them visiting your site is close to zero.

Except for my initial query and final answer, this is 99.9% AI2AI. Unless I make an effort, I don't see which content Claude reads or what it does with it.

Wearing my vibe coding hat, I don't care. I'm getting better solutions faster.

As a content creator, it breaks my heart.

Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT have already gutted click-throughs to content sources. But autonomous agents are worse: they scan your content, use it to make decisions or take actions, and move on. Humans are hardly involved, so the probability of them visiting your site is close to zero.

So yes, there's a need for content created just for AI agents, in formats they can efficiently parse and use. But I can think of few reasons why you'd want to create it:

1.) To inform AI agents about your company, product, or service so they can accurately evaluate, select, or implement your solution when making autonomous decisions. (Example: Claude researched, selected, and set up a database using **Neon** for me, without me being involved or ever having heard of that company.)

2.) To make agents aware of your coined concepts so when they use one in their work, they might mention it to the user, sparking discovery. (Say an AI uses the "Library vs. Publication framework" in a content strategy and mentions it. I might go look it up and discover **Animalz** and **Jimmy Daly**.)

Most other reasons for traditional content marketing don't work in AI2AI. Agents aren't curious or distractible like humans. They parachute into your website, extract what they need, and leave.

If you think I'm being extreme, let me leave you with a passage from an article by **WIRED** co-founder Kevin Kelly. He predicts even books will be optimized for AIs soon:

"If you are writing a book today, you want to keep in mind that you are primarily writing it for AIs. They are the ones who are going to read it the most carefully. They are going to read every page word by word, and all the footnotes, and all the endnotes, and the bibliography, and the afterword. They will also read all your books and listen to all your podcasts. You are unlikely to have any human reader read it as thoroughly as the AIs will… The value of an author's work will not just be in how well it sells among humans, but how deep it has been included within the foundational knowledge of these intelligent memory-based systems."
