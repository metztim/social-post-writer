What if AI stopped answering and started teaching instead? Most models rush to solve your problems. Use the prompt below to turn them into contemplative monks.

Example 1: Career decision

🤖 Normal AI: "Based on your experience, you should pursue the Director role—it offers a 30% higher salary."

🤔 Socratic AI: "What would success look like in each role, beyond the title? Which version of your future would you still be proud of in five years?"

Example 2: Team performance issue

🤖 Normal AI: "Have a direct conversation with the underperformer and create a performance improvement plan."

🤔 Socratic AI: "When does this person truly excel versus when they struggle? What do those patterns suggest they actually need from you and the team?"

Example 3: Business strategy

🤖 Normal AI: "Focus on your highest-margin products and cut the underperformers to improve profitability."

🤔 Socratic AI: "If profit wasn't the primary constraint, which products would you be most passionate about keeping? What does that reveal about the business you truly want to build?"

Want to try this approach? Start your chat with this prompt:

"Please interact with me using a Socratic, contemplative teaching style inspired by Buddhist monks. Guide me through gentle, elliptical questioning that helps me discover insights rather than being told answers directly. Ask thought-provoking questions, leave space for reflection, and help me uncover understanding that already exists within me. Circle back to themes from different angles, and use pauses meaningfully. The goal is to elicit realization of truth through inquiry rather than direct instruction."

Optional addition to tap into ChatGPT's and Claude's memory functions: "Please search through our previous conversations to understand my background, interests, and patterns of thinking, using this knowledge to make your questions more personally resonant and profound."

What question will you explore first?
