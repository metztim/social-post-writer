You think you're designing an AI workflow. Turns out you're peeling an onion with three layers:

1. **Nailing the workflow itself:** Getting the output you want. Hard enough.

2. **The "UX" of the workflow:** Making it usable for people who didn't build it, like your busy coworkers or customers.

3. **The organizational "fallout" from the workflow:** AI gets to the same output differently than humans do. Suddenly you have to change processes, roles, and materials across the org for the AI workflow to work.

Example: Peter Carlton and I are building a series of AirOps workflows to support LinkedIn thought leadership for execs and founders.

One of them turns raw materials (e.g., interview transcripts or blog posts) into LinkedIn post briefs. The output is a full brief with the angle, format, and all the curated verbatim source materials a writer needs to create the post.

By the time we had high quality, useful briefs coming out, the workflow itself was kinda messy: lots of input fields to fill out to get started and some clunky human review steps along the way.

That brought us to step 2: "polishing" the workflow by creating clear instructions and using specific AirOps features like Brand Kits so others can actually operate it.

Now we've started work on the third, outer layer of the onion: instead of collecting materials on an adhoc basis for each workflow, we're creating a structured system for defining, storing, and maintaining everything we need to run our workflows.

Building such a system is a technical challenge, an expertise challenge, and perhaps even an org design challenge (do we need new / adjusted roles for any of this?).

So beware choking on the onion when you plan to implement AI (workflows) systematically in your company. AI implementations aren't just about process design and tech. They spiral out into UX design, change management, and org restructuring.
