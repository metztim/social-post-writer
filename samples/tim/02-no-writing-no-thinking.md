This quote is on my mind: "Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about." — Shane Parrish, Farnam Street

People who love the pen have long argued that writing is thinking; those who don't the opposite.

I've always been agnostic about it: show me a better way to think than writing, and I can be convinced.

Sure, you can come up with an idea in the shower, or clarify your thinking during a conversation, or spin up a quick LinkedIn hit with AI, or wing it during an interview.

But when you really want to create a concept that's defensible, valuable, and long-lasting, you'll need to write it out.

Putting something down on paper forces you to face the gaps and absurdities and assumptions going on in your fuzzy thinking brain. You can't talk your way over, around, or out of an unresolved problem when you're writing.

The writer's wrestling process leads you to new insights, sometimes even better or completely new ideas. And having your thinking on paper allows others to follow along and give you feedback in a way that conversation doesn't allow.

Of course, all of this is on my mind because AI promises us we can skip or cut short this process.

I'm more and more convinced this is a mirage. Unless we can find a better way to think than writing, we'll have to reserve a place for that activity in our creative process, to figure out what it is we want to say, add, or contradict, no matter how good the robots get at producing the words we want.

My question for today: if not through writing, how do you think?
