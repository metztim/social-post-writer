Ever since ChatGPT came out, I've been trying to create an AI styleguide checker. It's never worked, until I tried with Claude Code last week.

The reason for trying again is a bit shameful: our Animalz style guide was outdated, and I'd sometimes finish articles so close to deadline that I couldn't run them past our copy-editors anymore.

(Deadly sin, I know.)

In trying to have a solution for such situations in the future, I gave Claude Code a challenge: reverse-engineer our style guide from scratch.

1. Analyze three blog posts from 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 (15 in total) along factors that style guides and copyeditors typically pay attention to.
2. Build a new style guide from the patterns.
3. Flag conflicts for me to resolve.

Critically, I told Claude Code to use multiple agents, each one focused on a different aspect: headers and capitalization, punctuation, grammar, etc. And since Claude Code can search the web, it fetched all 15 posts directly from our blog -- no manual downloads needed.

With this done, I asked Claude Code to edit an article for me based on this guide. Eight agents launched in parallel, each enforcing their piece of the guide. It actually worked, and I got back a copy-edited version of my article!

You can replicate this yourself with Claude Code, whether you're working from an existing style guide or reverse engineering one from scratch based on content you already have.

(Not sure how to get started with Claude Code? We've just released a getting started guide on the Animalz blog -- link below in the comments.)
