I posted on LinkedIn every weekday for a month.

Two things I learned contradict each other completely:

1) Posting daily is easier than posting once in a while

For me, posting daily beats vague goals like "post twice a week." With daily, there's no decision, it just has to happen.

It reminds me of a Gretchen Rubin quote: "What you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while."

2) Posting daily is too much

While the rhythm is helpful, a post a day also has disadvantages:

→ Sometimes you post something half-baked

→ Some days you spend 50+ minutes on a post when you budgeted 25

→ Five posts a week overwhelm your network

→ You keep checking those red notifications 😀

So what to do with this tension?

Let go of the daily rhythm, and I'll probably miss my goals.

Keep it, and I'm stuck with the downsides.

For October, I'm trying this:

• 25 mins of post writing and research every day.
• Two published posts per week on fixed days: Tuesdays and Thursdays.

This approach gives me more time to develop posts, caps my daily time, while keeping a real shipping schedule.

If you've done daily posting, what did you learn?

Big thanks to the **Superpath** community challenge hosted by **Eric Doty** and everyone who participated! 🙏
