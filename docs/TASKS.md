## Active Tasks

### [ ] Test `/write` with a real article end-to-end
**Status:** Ready
**Description:** Take the 8-phase `/write` process through a full article from foundation to review.

### [ ] Add animalzco Notion workspace to MCP integration
**Status:** Blocked (requires separate integration setup)
**Description:** Personal Notion integration only connects to personal workspace. Animalzco workspace has internal KB (thesis FAQ, headline generator) that would enrich `/write`.
