## The 6 Critical Deletions (User's Editorial DNA)

The user deleted these from my draft - NEVER include these patterns:

1. ❌ **Meta-commentary:** "There's a name for this now"
2. ❌ **Overly casual research intro:** "Turns out this is everywhere:"
3. ❌ **Redundant setup:** "Workslop doesn't eliminate work. It shifts it..."
4. ❌ **Direct accusations:** "You used AI to save yourself time by not thinking. I lose time figuring out what you meant."
5. ❌ **Editorial flourishes:** "AI can be powerful for collaboration. But this isn't collaboration—it's cognitive burden-shifting."
6. ❌ **Question framing:** "My question for today:" + multiple questions

**Pattern:** User cuts anything that tells readers how to feel, accuses them, or over-explains.

## The 4 Critical Additions (User's Voice Markers)

What the user ADDED to my draft:

1. ✅ **Playful irony:** "congrats," + exclamation point
2. ✅ **Source specificity:** "BetterUp Labs and Stanford" (not just "researchers")
3. ✅ **Conversational transitions:** "That's not all though."
4. ✅ **Source credibility signal:** "(Full HBR article in the comments.)"

**Pattern:** User adds playful tone markers and specific sources for credibility.

## Structural Patterns

### Line Breaks for Rhythm
User changed this paragraph:
> "But as you start reading, something feels off. The content is vague. Key details are missing. You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this."

To this (with line breaks):
> "But as you start reading, something feels off.
>
> The content is vague.
> Key details are missing.
> You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this."

**Use line breaks to create staccato rhythm and build emotional intensity.**

### Stats Get White Space
Each bullet point and stat block should have breathing room. Don't cram stats into paragraphs.

## CTA Formula

❌ **Too wordy:**
> "My question for today: have you encountered workslop at work? How did you handle it?"

✅ **User's version:**
> "Have you been workslopped recently?"

**Pattern:** One simple, direct question. No framing. No follow-ups.

---

## Tone Spectrum

User balances between:

**Playful/Ironic** ← → **Professional/Credible**

- **Playful zone:** Hooks, transitions ("congrats," "That's not all though")
- **Professional zone:** Research presentation, source citations
- **Avoid:** Preachy, accusatory, over-explained

---

## The Core Rule

**Show, don't tell. Let the concept speak for itself.**

If you find yourself:
- Telling readers what to think → Delete it
- Explaining why something is important → Delete it
- Using "you" in an accusatory way → Delete it
- Adding editorial commentary → Delete it

Trust the reader. Trust the concept. Get out of the way.

## Quick Checklist for Future Drafts

Before submitting a draft, check:

- [ ] Did I use "coworker" not "colleague"?
- [ ] Did I include specific source names (not just "researchers")?
- [ ] Did I use line breaks for emotional rhythm?
- [ ] Did I avoid meta-commentary like "Here's what's interesting"?
- [ ] Did I avoid direct accusations ("You did X, I suffer Y")?
- [ ] Did I avoid editorial flourishes that over-explain?
- [ ] Is my CTA one simple question with no framing?
- [ ] Did I add a source link reference?
- [ ] Did I use conversational transitions where appropriate?
- [ ] Did I give stats their own visual space?

## Most Important Insight

**The user's editorial strength is in deletion, not addition.**

They know what to cut. My job as Claude is to give them good raw material and trust their editorial eye to remove what doesn't serve the core message.

Don't try to be perfect. Try to be cuttable.
