## Key Findings at a Glance

### The Core Insight
**The user's editorial strength is in deletion, not addition.** They aggressively cut:
- Meta-commentary
- Direct accusations
- Over-explanation
- Editorial flourishes

### The Voice Formula
- **Conversational but credible** - playful in hooks, professional in research
- **Show, don't tell** - let concepts speak for themselves
- **White space as rhythm** - line breaks create emotional buildup
- **Simple, powerful CTAs** - one question, no framing

### The Non-Negotiables
Never include:
1. "There's a name for this now" (meta-commentary)
2. "You used AI... I lose time..." (accusatory you/I framing)
3. "AI can be powerful but this isn't..." (editorial flourish)
4. "My question for today:" (question framing)
5. "Turns out this is everywhere" (too casual for research)

Always include:
1. Specific source names (not just "researchers")
2. Playful irony in hooks ("congrats")
3. Source link reference at end
4. Line breaks for emotional rhythm
5. Conversational transitions ("That's not all though")
