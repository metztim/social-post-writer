# User's Editing Patterns: Reference Guide for AI Drafts

**Source:** Workslop post textual comparison
**Use Case:** Reference this when drafting LinkedIn posts to match user's voice

---

## Pattern 1: Word-Level Substitutions

### Always Replace

| Never Use | Always Use |
|-----------|------------|
| colleague | coworker |
| work content | materials |
| content | materials (in professional contexts) |

### Avoid These Phrases Entirely

- "There's a name for this now"
- "Turns out [statement]"
- "My question for today:"
- "At work, researchers call it"
- Any variation of "Let me tell you why this matters"

---

## Pattern 2: Sentence-Level Deletions

### Delete Redundant Setups

❌ **Original:**
> "Workslop doesn't eliminate work. It shifts it downstream."

✅ **Edited:**
> "Workslop shifts work downstream."

**Rule:** If the second sentence says the same thing as the first, delete the first.

---

### Delete Direct Accusations

❌ **Original:**
> "You used AI to save yourself time by not thinking. I lose time figuring out what you meant."

✅ **Edited:**
> [Deleted entirely]

**Rule:** Never use "You/I" framing that positions the reader as the problem. Focus on shared experiences, not blame.

---

### Delete Editorial Commentary

❌ **Original:**
> "AI can be powerful for collaboration. But this isn't collaboration—it's cognitive burden-shifting."

✅ **Edited:**
> [Deleted entirely]

**Rule:** If the concept is already clear from context, don't add editorial flourish. Trust the reader.

---

## Pattern 3: Paragraph Structure & Line Breaks

### Use Line Breaks for Emotional Buildup

❌ **Dense paragraph:**
> "But as you start reading, something feels off. The content is vague. Key details are missing. You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this."

✅ **Staccato rhythm:**
> "But as you start reading, something feels off.
>
> The content is vague.
> Key details are missing.
> You're not sure what you're supposed to do with this."

**Rule:** When listing problems/symptoms, give each its own line. Creates mounting tension.

---

### Stats Get Visual Space

❌ **Paragraph format:**
> "The study found that 40% received workslop in the last month, each incident takes nearly 2 hours to deal with, and for a 10,000-person company that's $9 million/year in lost productivity."

✅ **Bullet format with space:**
> The researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees and found that:
>
> • 40% received workslop in the last month
> • Each incident takes nearly 2 hours to deal with
> • For a 10,000-person company: $9 million/year in lost productivity

**Rule:** Stats should be scannable. Use bullets and white space.

---

## Pattern 4: Opening Hook Modifications

### Add Playful Irony

❌ **Straightforward:**
> "If this sounds familiar, you've been workslopped."

✅ **With irony:**
> "If this sounds familiar, congrats, you've been workslopped!"

**Rule:** When introducing a negative concept the reader might relate to, add light irony ("congrats") + exclamation point.

---

### Merge for Momentum

❌ **Too many short paragraphs:**
> "You open a document from a coworker.
>
> Looks professional at first. Formatted nicely, plenty of text.
>
> But as you start reading, something feels off."

✅ **Merged opening:**
> "You open a document from a coworker. Looks professional at first. Formatted nicely, plenty of text. But as you start reading, something feels off."

**Rule:** Keep the opening flowing until the "turn" moment. Then use line breaks.

---

## Pattern 5: Source Attribution Style

### Be Specific with Sources

❌ **Vague:**
> "Stanford surveyed 1,150 full-time employees."

or

> "At work, researchers call it workslop"

✅ **Specific:**
> "For the work context, researchers from BetterUp Labs and Stanford have coined this 'workslop'"

and

> "The researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees and found that:"

**Rule:** Include specific organization names when introducing concepts. Use "the researchers" for subsequent references.

---

### Add Source Links

Always include at end:
> "(Full HBR article in the comments.)"

or

> "(Link to research in comments.)"

**Rule:** Signal that there's a credible source backing your claims.

---

## Pattern 6: Call-to-Action Simplification

### One Question Only

❌ **Multiple questions:**
> "My question for today: have you encountered workslop at work? How did you handle it?"

✅ **Single, direct:**
> "Have you been workslopped recently?"

**Rule:**
- No framing ("My question for today")
- One question only
- Make it personal and memorable

---

## Pattern 7: Tense & Voice Precision

### Past Perfect for Completed Actions

❌ **Present continuous:**
> "From the person who should be thinking"

✅ **Past perfect:**
> "From the person who should have done the thinking"

**Rule:** When describing what should have happened but didn't, use past perfect.

---

## Pattern 8: Transition Phrases

### Add Conversational Markers

❌ **Abrupt:**
> "But the interpersonal cost might be worse."

✅ **With transition:**
> "That's not all though. The interpersonal cost might be worse."

**Rule:** Use conversational transitions ("That's not all though," "Here's the thing," "But wait") to signal topic shifts.

---

## Pattern 9: Research Presentation

### Casual → Professional in Data Sections

❌ **Too casual:**
> "Stanford surveyed 1,150 full-time employees. Turns out this is everywhere:"

✅ **More professional:**
> "The researchers surveyed 1,150 full-time employees and found that:"

**Rule:** Be conversational in hooks and transitions, but present research findings professionally.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

### 1. Meta-Commentary
❌ "There's a name for this now"
❌ "Here's what's interesting"
❌ "Let me explain why this matters"

### 2. Over-Explaining
❌ "This is important because..."
❌ "The reason this matters is..."
❌ Adding explanation after the concept is already clear

### 3. Accusatory "You/I" Framing
❌ "You did X, and I had to deal with Y"
❌ "When you use AI without thinking..."
❌ Any formulation that blames the reader

### 4. Question Framing
❌ "My question for today:"
❌ "I want to ask you:"
❌ "Here's what I'm wondering:"

### 5. Apologetic/Hedging Language
❌ "This might be controversial but..."
❌ "Some people might disagree but..."
❌ "I think that..."

---

## Positive Patterns (Always Do This)

### 1. Show Through Scenario
✅ Start with concrete experience
✅ Build through specific details
✅ Let reader recognize themselves

### 2. Source Credibility
✅ Name specific research organizations
✅ Include publication references
✅ Link to full articles in comments

### 3. Visual Rhythm
✅ Use line breaks for emphasis
✅ Give stats their own lines
✅ Create white space around key points

### 4. Conversational Professionalism
✅ Use transitions like "That's not all though"
✅ Add irony where appropriate ("congrats")
✅ Stay professional in research presentation

### 5. Simple CTAs
✅ One question
✅ No framing
✅ Make it personal and memorable

## When in Doubt

Ask yourself:
1. Am I telling the reader how to feel? → Delete it
2. Am I explaining something already clear? → Delete it
3. Am I using "you" in an accusatory way? → Reframe or delete
4. Am I adding meta-commentary? → Delete it
5. Am I over-complicating the CTA? → Simplify

**Remember:** User's strength is in deletion. Give them good raw material and trust their editorial eye.
