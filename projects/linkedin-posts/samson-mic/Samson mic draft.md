What am I doing here: recording a podcast? Zooming? Something else?
(Answer below. Includes Black Friday or holiday gift idea. 🎁)

Originally, I got this **SAMSON Q9U mic** for recording the Animalz podcast, and it’s terrific for that. 

I’ve had several other mics before, including the Blue Yeti, but this SAMSON mic is incredible and incomparable. So if you do podcasts a lot (or even important calls), I highly recommend it.

However, another use case has emerged this year as well: I’m increasingly using it to talk to my computer, especially AIs like Claude Code.

Since I have the mic on a boom arm, I just pull it toward me when I need to chat with Claude, and push it away when I'm done.

Originally, I did this using macOS’ in-built dictation function, but it isn’t great and the UX is quite clunky. Instead, for about a month now, I’ve been using the Monologue app from Every Media for this purpose, and it’s amazing.

Monologue picks up context from where you’re dictating, so that it cleans and adapts the transcript of your voice to whatever it is you’re doing. 

These days when I'm working from home, I'm talking to my computer about half the time instead of typing. It took some getting used to, but now it feels strange not to have the mic there.

So if you’re working a lot at your computer with AI and are looking for a Black Friday purchase or holiday gift, I’d say:

**SAMSON Q9U mic** + **38" Microphone Boom Arm + Monologue.**

Happy holidays! 😊
