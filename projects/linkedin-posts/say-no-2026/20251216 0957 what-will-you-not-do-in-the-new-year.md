What are you NOT going to do in 2026?  

We make lists of everything we’re planning to do in the new year. But intentions about attractive opportunities you’re going to say no to are at least as important.

Warren Buffett supposedly told his pilot to list 25 goals, circle the top 5, and actively avoid the rest; they'd only distract from what mattered most.

Emily Kramer of MTK1 recommends it as a tactic for handling internal marketing requests:

“Making a list of things you **can't** do this quarter or year is almost as critical as saying what you will do. \[…\] It gives you a chance to explain and give the why behind the conscious prioritization decisions you made.”

For us humans, adding coming naturally. And with AI, it’s even easier to pile on to our plans and intentions.

Subtracting is counter-intuitive, but at least as valuable. As Lao Tzu advised xxx years ago: “To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day.”

So let’s inspire each other to be conscious about a project or task or undertaking we’re NOT going to do in 2026, so we have more time for what’s truly important.
