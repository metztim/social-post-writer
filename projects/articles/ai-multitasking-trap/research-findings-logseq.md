*Compiled: 2025-10-06*

---

## 1. STRONG RESEARCH DATA ON MULTITASKING COSTS

### Task Switching Cost Statistics

**From: The ONE Thing (Gary Keller)**
> "The cost in terms of extra time from having to task switch depends on how complex or simple the tasks are. It can range from time increases of 25 percent or less for simple tasks to well over 100 percent or more for very complicated tasks."
- Location: 468
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Provides hard numbers for the switching costs you mention. AI tasks are complex, so they're likely on the higher end (100%+ time cost).
- **Suggested placement:** In your "Seconds vs. Minutes vs. Hours" section where you discuss the cost of switching

**From: The ONE Thing**
> "Researchers estimate we lose 28 percent of an average workday to multitasking ineffectiveness."
- Location: 494
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Quantifies the daily productivity loss from multitasking
- **Suggested placement:** Early in the article to establish the scale of the problem

**From: BrainChains (Theo Compernolle)**
> "Even for a simple task like completing a jigsaw puzzle, a single interruption causes a speed reduction of 26%. For a more complex task, it causes a 70% decline in correct answers per minute."
- Location: 2718
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Shows interruption costs even for simple tasks; AI work is definitely complex
- **Suggested placement:** After you introduce the multitasking problem

**From: BrainChains**
> "Uninterrupted work is up to four times more efficient if the tasks are complex or if the tasks belong to very different domains like work and home."
- Location: 5897
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Directly supports your argument that switching between AI tasks is particularly costly
- **Suggested placement:** Core argument section about why AI encourages bad behavior

### The Illusion of Efficiency

**From: BrainChains**
> "We are continuously multitasking and task-hopping, making us at least four times less intellectually productive than we could be if we single-tasked or at least right-tasked."
- Location: 2579
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Quantifies the productivity loss and introduces "right-tasking" concept
- **Suggested placement:** When discussing alternatives to multitasking

**From: BrainChains**
> "The brainworkers themselves, especially the addicted ones, think that being connected all the time makes them more efficient. They have clearly never heard about all the research that proves the opposite."
- Location: 2673
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Supports your point about people believing they're productive when they're not
- **Suggested placement:** Near footnote 2 where you discuss the productivity belief paradox

---

## 2. THE "MINUTES PROBLEM" - YOUR CORE ARGUMENT

This is the heart of your article - that AI feedback loops happen in minutes, which is the worst possible timeframe.

**From: A World Without Email (Cal Newport)**
> "More than two thirds of the users never experienced an hour or more of uninterrupted time during the period studied. The average user studied had only fifteen such uninterrupted buckets, adding up to no more than an hour and fifteen minutes total of undistracted productive work per day."
- Location: 340-351
- **Why this strengthens your article:** CRUCIAL DATA - shows that people already can't get hour-long blocks, which is exactly what you're arguing AI makes worse
- **Suggested placement:** In your "Seconds vs. Minutes vs. Hours" section to show the current state

**From: The Distracted Mind (Gazzaley & Rosen)**
> "Workers who use computers during the day change windows or check e-mail or other programs nearly 37 times an hour."
- Location: 500
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Shows the current interrupt frequency (every 1.6 minutes)
- **Suggested placement:** Early to establish baseline behavior before AI

**From: The Distracted Mind**
> "The younger adults switched from task to task twenty-seven times per hour—once every two minutes—the older adults were not all that great at maintaining their attention either, switching tasks seventeen times per hour, or once every three to four minutes."
- Location: 2152
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Matches your minutes-scale problem perfectly
- **Suggested placement:** When discussing typical work patterns

**From: The Distracted Mind**
> "Dr. Rosen's lab observed students—ranging from middle school to college age—studying for fifteen minutes in an area where they normally study. Shockingly, students could not focus for more than three to five minutes even when they were told to study something very important."
- Location: 2159
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Shows how fragmented attention has become
- **Suggested placement:** To illustrate the attention crisis

## 3. POWERFUL QUOTES BY THEME

### The Illusion of Productivity

**From: Four Thousand Weeks (Oliver Burkeman)**
> "The problem isn't exactly that these techniques and products don't work. It's that they do work—in the sense that you'll get more done, race to more meetings, ferry your kids to more after-school activities, generate more profit for your employer—and yet, paradoxically, you only feel busier, more anxious, and somehow emptier as a result."
- Location: 105
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Perfectly captures the paradox you describe - doing more but feeling worse
- **Suggested placement:** When discussing why multitasking with AI feels productive but isn't

**From: The Productivity Project (Chris Bailey)**
> "Just because you feel productive doesn't mean you are—and the opposite is often true."
- Location: 3181
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Concise statement of the productivity illusion
- **Suggested placement:** Could be a pull quote or in your section on feeling productive

**From: Four Thousand Weeks**
> "Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster."
- Location: 163
- **Why this strengthens your article:** The "efficiency trap" concept - doing more just creates more to do
- **Suggested placement:** Near your discussion of Katie's approach

### Quality vs. Quantity of Time

**From: It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work (via your draft)**
The quote you already use about 1×60 vs 2×30 etc. is perfect and well-placed.

**From: Deep Work (Cal Newport)**
> "High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)"
- Location: 482
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Mathematical formulation showing why fragmented time hurts quality
- **Suggested placement:** When discussing the cost of context switching

**From: A World Without Email**
> "When you can see that attention residue exists... you realize that doing fewer things makes us better at our jobs; not only psychologically, but also economically and creatively."
- Location: 710
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Sophie Leroy's attention residue concept - explains why switching leaves mental "residue"
- **Suggested placement:** In explaining the science of switching costs

### The Efficiency Trap

**From: Four Thousand Weeks**
> "So it's not simply that you never get through your email; it's that the process of 'getting through your email' actually generates more email... Far from getting things done, you'll be creating new things to do."
- Location: 492
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Explains the feedback loop you're describing with AI
- **Suggested placement:** When discussing why speeding up doesn't help

**From: A World Without Email**
> "When you agree to a new commitment, be it a minor task or a large project, it brings with it a certain amount of ongoing administrative overhead... This overhead tax activates as soon as you take on a new responsibility."
- Location: 657-662
- **Why this strengthens your article:** The "overhead tax" concept - each AI task brings coordination overhead
- **Suggested placement:** When explaining why multiple AI tasks compound the problem

---

## 4. SUPPORTING CONCEPTS TO ADD DEPTH

### Attention Residue (Sophie Leroy)

**From: A World Without Email**
> "When you hit a ceiling of achievement, they look for new models and systems, better ways to do things to push them through. They pause just long enough to examine their options, they pick the best one, and then they're right back at it."
- Location: 425-440 (discussing Leroy's research)
- **Concept:** When you switch tasks, part of your attention remains stuck on the previous task
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Explains WHY switching between AI tasks is so draining
- **Suggested placement:** In the science section explaining switching costs

### The Manager vs. Maker Schedule Problem

**From: How I Run Three AI Models in Parallel (Katie Parrott's article)**
> "For 15 years, we treated Graham's divide as gospel: Protect the makers, and let the managers coordinate. Companies built entire cultures around this—no-meeting Wednesdays, focus-time blocks, elaborate systems to guard deep work from the tyranny of the calendar. But model management scrambles these neat categories."
- Location: 10
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Katie herself acknowledges this violates the maker/manager divide
- **Suggested placement:** Expand your discussion of the manager comparison

**From: A World Without Email**
> "Your writing time has dropped 40 percent, but your weekly output has tripled. At least, it has when the kitchen is running smoothly."
- From Katie's article via A World Without Email highlights
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Shows the tradeoff - more output, less deep work time
- **Suggested placement:** When discussing Katie's experience

### The 3% Super-Taskers

**From: BrainChains**
> "3% of people thrive when multitasking, everyone else's performance suffers."
- (Referenced in your article already)
- **Additional context from BrainChains:** "The percentage of people who can live healthily on 6 hours of sleep is less than 3%." (Location 4009)
- **Why this matters:** Shows the 3% pattern - biological outliers exist but are rare
- **Suggested placement:** Your "Still convinced you're a great multitasker?" section

### Attention Capital Principle

**From: A World Without Email**
> "The productivity of the knowledge sector can be significantly increased if we identify workflows that better optimize the human brain's ability to sustainably add value to information."
- Location: 1614
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Provides framework for thinking about knowledge work optimization
- **Suggested placement:** In your hopeful ending about future solutions

## 5. SOLUTIONS FOR YOUR ENDING

Your article ends hopefully, suggesting AI will get faster or handle whole projects. Here are concepts to strengthen that:

### Time Horizons Matter

**From: Slow Productivity (Cal Newport)**
> "Don't rush your most important work. Allow it instead to unfold along a sustainable timeline, with variations in intensity, in settings conducive to brilliance."
- Location: 1399
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Supports your argument that we need different time horizons
- **Suggested placement:** In your conclusion about natural rhythms

**From: The ONE Thing**
> "What's the ONE Thing I can do / such that by doing it / everything else will be easier or unnecessary?"
- Location: 1097
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Alternative focusing question when working with AI
- **Suggested placement:** Optional - if you want to add a practical tip

### Accepting Limitations Productively

**From: Four Thousand Weeks**
> "The more you confront the facts of finitude instead—and work with them, rather than against them—the more productive, meaningful, and joyful life becomes."
- Location: 366
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Reframes limitations as opportunities
- **Suggested placement:** Near your conclusion

**From: Four Thousand Weeks**
> "To approach your days in this fashion means, instead of clearing the decks, declining to clear the decks, focusing instead on what's truly of greatest consequence while tolerating the discomfort of knowing that, as you do so, the decks will be filling up further."
- Location: 580
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Describes a sustainable approach - accepting you can't do everything
- **Suggested placement:** Alternative approach to Katie's method

### Workflow Innovation

**From: A World Without Email**
> "Knowledge work does not yet have its Henry Ford, but workflow innovations with impact on the same scale as the assembly line are inevitable."
- Location: 208
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Historical perspective on your hope that AI workflows will improve
- **Suggested placement:** In your optimistic ending

## 6. CLASSIC QUOTES TO OPEN SECTIONS

**From: The Myth of Multitasking (Lord Chesterfield)**
> "There is time enough for everything in the course of the day, if you do but one thing at once, but there is not time enough in the year, if you will do two things at a time. This steady and undissipated attention to one object, is a sure mark of a superior genius; as hurry, bustle, and agitation, are the never-failing symptoms of a weak and frivolous mind."
- 1740s letter
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Timeless wisdom that predates digital age
- **Suggested placement:** Could open your multitasking section or be a pull quote

**From: BrainChains**
> "The problem is not the great technology, but the way we use it."
- Location: 2587
- **Why this strengthens your article:** Sets up your hopeful ending - tech isn't the problem, workflows are
- **Suggested placement:** Near conclusion

## 7. SPECIFIC DATA POINTS TO ADD

### Email/Message Frequency
- **BrainChains:** "Some people check up to 30 to 40 times an hour" (Location 2651)
- **A World Without Email:** "By 2019 the average worker was sending and receiving 126 business emails per day, which works out to about one message every four minutes" (Location 127)

### Cost of Interruptions
- **The Distracted Mind:** "On average, the workers spent ten minutes dealing with the alerts and then took an additional ten to fifteen minutes to return to their appointed task" (Location 2223)
- **The Productivity Project:** "Each employee spent only 11 minutes on any given project before being interrupted, and it took the average employee twenty-five minutes to return to the initial task" (Location 3087)

### Focus Duration
- **The Distracted Mind:** "Students were able to stay focused and attend to that important work only for a short period of time—three to five minutes—before most students self-interrupted" (Location 2262)
