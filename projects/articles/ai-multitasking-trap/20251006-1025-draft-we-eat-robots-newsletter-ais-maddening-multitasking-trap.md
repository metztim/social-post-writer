AI’s Maddening Multitasking Trap

In [_How I Run Three AI Models in Parallel Without Losing My Mind_](https://every.to/working-overtime/how-i-run-three-ai-models-in-parallel-without-losing-my-mind), Katie Parrott at Every brilliantly describes a problem I have too: working with AI makes me multitask like a pinball.

Katie includes practical tips in her piece on how to deal with the problem, like limiting your active tasks to three and dropping one line notes (“breadcrumbs”) about what to do next for the current task before switching to another.

Still, I’m convinced this multitasking craziness is a losing game.

## The Problem with Multitasking

Over the past two decades, I’ve read pretty much every article, book, and study[1](#fn:1) there is about multitasking and how it undermines your productivity[2](#fn:2).

**There’s a huge cost in switching between tasks paid in fatigue, stress, and time.** The most important facts:

- 3% of people thrive when multitasking, everyone else’s performance suffers.
- The more you multitask, the more you _believe_ you’re being more productive, but you’re not.
- The side-effects of multitasking apply to [deep work](https://www.saent.com/blog/deep-work-cal-newport-book-review-summary) but also smaller tasks. Even glancing at a phone notification is multitasking and costs you[3](#fn:3).
- Switching sometimes helps when you’re truly stuck, but that point usually comes after hours, not seconds or minutes.

In [_It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work_](https://amzn.to/2D5wUJF), [**Jason Fried**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-fried/) and [**David Heinemeier Hansson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-heinemeier-hansson-374b18221/) beautifully express this idea:

> There are lots of ways to slice 60 minutes.  
> 1 × 60 = 60  
> 2 × 30 = 60  
> 4 × 15 = 60  
> 25 + 10 + 5 + 15 + 5 = 60  
>   
> All of the above equal 60, but they’re different kinds of hours entirely. The number might be the same, but the quality isn’t.  
>   
> The quality hour we’re after is 1 × 60.

Now, why does AI encourage this behavior?

As you become more advanced in your AI usage, you’re likely going to give multiple tasks to multiple AI models and agents, _because_ they take time to complete their assignments.

Instead of waiting around for one to complete, you get it started, give another task to a second AI, and even a third. Then you return to the first to check its work, then the second, and so on.

Katie compares this to the work of a manager (and the video game _Overcooked_, in which you “play line cooks in a chaotic kitchen, sprinting between stations while orders pile up and the clock ticks down.”)

## Seconds vs. Minutes vs. Hours

I can’t speak to the video game, but the manager comparison is accurate, except for one critical difference: **managers don’t have to chunk up their time in seconds or minutes** (though many do). They wait for hours or days to get back results from their reports.

With AI, your feedback loop is usually minutes.

Herein lies the real problem: **minutes are too long to wait around and do nothing, but too short to avoid the averse effects of hyper-multitasking.**

And so you arrive at the situation Katie describes: on a good day, you _feel_ productive[4](#fn:4), but probably still pretty tired from all the switching. On most others, everything is messy and you’re hungover.

## Why this multitasking problem might disappear soon

My hope: this multitasking problem will go away by itself, and perhaps you’ll never experience it, for two reasons:

1. Most people aren’t yet running multiple AI agents or [Claude Code](https://weeatrobots.substack.com/p/claude-code-productivity-tool-guide-2025) sessions in parallel.
2. AI will get faster and more sophisticated, eliminating tasks that take minutes, just leaving the ones that take seconds and hours.

By the time many more people are assigning multiple tasks and projects to AI agents and workflows, they’ll either be really fast (completing single tasks within seconds) and able to handle entire projects (many tasks) meaning they go off and work for hours.

We’ve then reached the same state managers of human reports now experience: you can collaborate on a single task together with your AI without the wait times, or assign them a project and get back the results hours later.

Such timelines return us to a fitting rhythm for our human brains: working on one thing at a time, or at least breaking up our tasks in 10+ minutes, the minimum chunk that in my experience prevents the worse effects of multitasking.

Of course, that still leaves the problems many people experience with multitasking today, which is mostly self-inflicted as a kind of escape from having to deal with the task at hand, but perhaps AI can help with that as well and keep you on track.

## Still convinced you’re a great multitasking?

You might belong to those 3% of super taskers, but that chance is, well three out of 100. Here’s my final attempt to convince (and prove!) otherwise:

1. Watch [this brilliant explanation](https://youtu.be/Yqi9Gwt-OEA?si=yNMTnqaxPlJJnxw0) of Henrik Kniberg on the problem and cost of context switching.
2. Do [this simple exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xup2ePrjEbY) I recorded in my previous life. It takes a few minutes and you’ll experience exactly what happens when you multitask (and find out if you’re a super tasker or not!).

## This Week’s Highlights

1. I was first introduced to the idea that multitasking doesn’t work through Getting Things Done. [_BrainChains_](https://www.saent.com/blog/brainchains-theo-compernolle-book-review-summary) _is_ packed with research about this topic. [_Meet the Super Taskers_](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201401/meet-the-super-taskers) is also a classic and fascinating read.
2. _As long time subscribers know, I founded a productivity hardware + software startup in a previous life._
3. _So it’s not just creative folks who suffer from this. Even managers do much better when they work in 10 or 15 or 20 min. intervals vs. switching every few minutes or seconds._
4. But that might still be an illusion, as mentioned earlier in the article: “The more you multitask, the more you _believe_ you’re being more productive, but you’re not.”
