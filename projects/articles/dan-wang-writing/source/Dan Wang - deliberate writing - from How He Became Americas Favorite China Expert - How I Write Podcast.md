Yeah. I mean, a lot of people think, oh, you got to write all the time. You got to publish every single week. But you're saying, hey, I wrote for 10 days a year. I spent all year basically prepping for that. And then I poured my heart and soul into it from December 20th to the time I said Happy New Year.
Dan Wang
I think, and this is something that I would really encourage more writers, young writers especially, to try to do. I am a big fan of Substack. I think that Substack is an excellent product. And I think that Substack has really enabled a lot of writers really to make their lives and make a career out of writing itself. There's plenty of people in San Francisco now who are able to be self-supporting, be able to live in San Francisco by writing out on Substack. My gripe with Substack is that it, like every other technology that comes before it, is really encouraging people to write at a more frequent cadence, a more frequent pacing. The tragedy of a lot of modern technologies is that it is really trying to make posts and thoughts as short as possible and as frequent as possible. And the apotheosis of this is Twitter. But I think the Substack model is really trying to encourage people to write a piece of week, a piece of month. And I was trying to bring down the average. I was trying to write one piece a year. And I think, you know, for most writers, um, now I can't keep up with most writers who are, um, coming up with a post every other day.

... the reflections, the well-crafted sentences, looking past the immediate headlines in order to deliver A product at the end of every year. And I was doing that in conjunction with doing my day job, which involved more frequent pace of writing for financial clients, people working in hedge funds who really wanted my quick Takes on stuff. But that was for my work audience. And my public product was much better considered and much more personal because I'm pretty sure that my hedge fund clients would give no figs about whatever I was eating at the noodle Shop in Quimbing. But I think I would also really love it if people were able to slow down a little bit and be a little bit more deliberate. It doesn't mean that you can't do your day job. It doesn't mean that you can't write every so often for magazines as I was doing it. In the year that I wrote my 2021 letter, I'd also published in The Atlantic as well as Foreign Affairs as well as The New York Times. And so I think that is the right pacing for a lot more people. And I hope many more people
